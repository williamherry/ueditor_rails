UEditor Rails
======

UEditor integration with Rails.

## Notes
not work on Rails 3.2.8, 3.2.13 is fine.

## Demo
Go to ```test/dummy``` and ```rails s```, remember ```bundle``` first.

## Installation
Add the gem to your Gemfie ```gem 'ueditor_rails', :git => 'https://github.com/williamherry/ueditor_rails.git'```.

```bundle``` and run ```rails g ueditor_rails:install```.

## Configure
See ```app/assets/javascripts/ueditor_config.js.erb``` for detail.

## Using
```#= require ueditor_config```(which generated at installation) to your `application.js.coffee` first.

**samples**

```f.ueditor_text :body```

```ueditor_text_tag 'test2', 'text here'```

```ueditor_text_tag 'test1', 'text here', :id => 'xxxx', :width => 500, :toolbars => [["bold","italic","underline"]]```

The option can be any which in ```ueditor_config.js.erb```.

## Upload backends
I don't want implement it, cause it's design depends your business, so you should do it by yourself. 
you can modify ```app/assets/javascripts/ueditor_config.js.erb``` like ```imageUrl: "<%= Rails.application.routes.url_helpers.ueditor_image_path %>"``` to make it available.

## Cross domain support
Add ```UeditorRails.enable_cross_domain = true``` in a initializer or 'application.rb'.
